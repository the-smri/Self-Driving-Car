Creates a track with a white path on dark background

Places a Tesla car sprite that follows the track automatically

Uses color detection to navigate - the car follows the white path (RGB 255)

Has collision detection points (up, down, right) to sense the track edges

Makes 90-degree turns automatically when detecting intersections

Shows a green dot representing the car's "camera" sensor

Is it just a game?
Not exactly - it's actually demonstrating real autonomous vehicle concepts:

✅ Real-world principles:

Sensor-based navigation (simulating cameras/LiDAR)

Path following algorithms

Decision making at intersections

Collision avoidance

❌ Game elements:

Simplified 2D environment

Basic color-based detection

Predefined track

Educational Value:
This could be used for:

Teaching basic autonomous vehicle programming

Prototyping pathfinding algorithms

Understanding sensor simulation

Learning about decision trees in robotics
